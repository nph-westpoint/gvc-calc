# gvc-calc
GVC-Calc was developed to assist researchers with Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data by West Point's AI Data Engineering and Machine Learning (AIDE-ML) Center. The focus of the tool is to calculate as many glycemic metrics as possible while documenting the choices that were made during the computation of each.
